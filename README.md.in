PoShAncestry
============

Quickly go back to a specific directory instead of typing `cd ..\\..\\..`
redundantly.  Based on [zsh-bd](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-bd) and
[bd](http://vigneshwaranr.github.io/bd/).

## Motivation

Traversing back through deeply nested directory structures is annoying.

``` PowerShell
C:\Dev\Projects\PowerShell\PoShAncestry> bd pro
C:\Dev\Projects>
```

PoShAncestry exports on a single command, [`Select-Ancestor`](#Select-Ancestor),
which will traverse up through the path to find the ancestor with the closest
name.  For convenience, the alias `bd` is also exported.

While `Select-Ancestor` does support tab completion, it will also match based on
leading characters.  As in the example above, `pro` will match the `Projects`
folder.  In the case of multiple potential matches, the closest ancestor will be
used, unless the `-First` switch is specified, in which case the farthest
ancestor will be selected.

## Installation

Manual installation:

1.  Create a `PoShAncestry` directory in your PowerShell modules folder.  You
    can find this be examining `$env:PSModulePath`.
2.  Download `PoShAncestry.psm1` and place it in your `PoShAncestry` directory.
3.  Add `Import-Module PoShAncestry` for your `$profile`.

{% Select-Ancestor %}

## Testing

A simple suite of [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) tests is included
in `PoShAncestry.Tests.ps1`.  Simply install Pester and execute `Invoke-Pester`
in the PoShAncestry directory to run the tests.
